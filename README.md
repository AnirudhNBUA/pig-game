## Game Rules

The game follows these rules:

1. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
2. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they score no points for that turn.
3. If a player rolls a number from 2 to 6, they have two options:
   - They can choose to roll again to accumulate more points.
   - They can choose to hold their current score and end their turn.
4. If a player chooses to roll again and rolls a 1, they lose all points earned during that turn, and their turn ends.
5. The points earned in each turn are added to the player's overall score.
6. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the target score of X points.
7. The player who reaches or exceeds the target score first is declared the winner.
